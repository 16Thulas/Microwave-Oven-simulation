# Microwave-Oven-simulation
Goal about the project was to develop a realistic microwave interface, integrating keypad input, timer functions, multiple cooking modes(MICRO,GRILL,CONVECTION) and CLCD display . In this, I have gained hands on experience in embedded system and real time simulations in pic microcontroller boards.
