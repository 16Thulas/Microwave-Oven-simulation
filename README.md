# Microwave-Oven-simulation
Goal about the project was to develop a realistic microwave interface, integrating keypad input, timer functions, multiple cooking modes(MICRO,GRILL,CONVECTION) and CLCD display . In this, I have gained hands on experience in embedded system and real time simulations in pic microcontroller boards.
Technologies Used: -> MPLAB IDE – For code development and debugging. -> PICSIM LAB - For simulation purposes. -> Embedded C – Firmware written for real-time operations.
I have enhanced my skill using PICSIM lab and MPLAB X IDE, which is designed with XC8 compiler specifically concentrated on PIC microcontroller(PIC16F877A),integrated within MPLAB X IDE making it ideal for embedded systems and development. In this , I have concentrated mainly on EMBEDDED C for integrating with microcontroller boards and simulation softwares.
It showcases microcontroller-based control, sensor integration, and user interaction, making it an ideal learning project for embedded systems enthusiasts.
According to the user selection it is set to cooking , power set timers and activate heating elements and in clcd file ensures to get printed what is actually happening in microwave oven like mode selection and countdown timers are displayed correctly, Timer function ensures precise countdown operation
